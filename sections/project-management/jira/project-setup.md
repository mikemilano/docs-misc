# Project Setup

## Enable Ranking

Ranking allows you to assign ranks in the backlog for a more granular way to order issues than priorities provide for.

If ranking isn't enabled, a Jira admin can configure the board as follows:

1. Navigate to the desired board, then click **Board > Configure**

2. Click the **Add Rank** button.

This will append the board filter with `ORDER BY Rank ASC`.

## Setting the Estimation Statistic

1. Navigate to the desired board, then click **Board > Configure**

2. Click the **Estimation** tab.

3. Set the **Estimation Statistic** to **Story Points**
