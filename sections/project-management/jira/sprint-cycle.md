# Sprint Cycle

Planning sprints is key to estimate with accuracy what can be accomplished during the next sprint. Estimates should
naturally become more accurate based on the performance of past sprints.

A standard sprint duration is 2 weeks, however this is not a hard rule. Different projects may be better suited for
different sprint durations based on factors such as resource allocation and client availability.

A sprint cycle consists of 3 events:

1. Preparing for the session
2. Sprint planning session
3. Closing the sprint

## Sprint Week

Sprint week is the week when existing sprints get closed, and new sprints opened.

### Monday - Preparing

The PM of each project will use Monday to rank the backlog based on client priorities.

Developers will will be working on the existing sprint through the end of the day and prioritizing any Blocker tasks.

Any tasks in the “Resolved” column should to be either reopened or closed before end of day.

### Tuesday

1. Close existing sprint
2. Plan new sprint
3. Open new sprint

Existing sprints will close either end of day Monday, or first thing on Tuesday morning.

#### The Sprint Planning Meeting

The PM will host a sprint planning meeting with developers to assign points to each item in the backlog which is to be
moved into the sprint.

Developers will have a say on each issue, even if it will not be assigned to them, on how many points should be assigned
to the issue. This time will also be used to vet out any issues which do not have enough information, or require
additional technical detail from a Sr. developer before being assigned out.

The meeting should be expected to last 1 or more hours depending on the amount of issues going into the new sprint.

The amount of issues moving into the sprint will be limited to an amount of points based on historic performance \(points 
achieved in previous sprints\), resources, and availability. At first, points may be pretty arbitrary term and can be 
related to work hours. Once the team has some experience in sprint planning with each other, the amount of points per 
week they know can be accomplished won't necessarily need to relate exactly to hours.
