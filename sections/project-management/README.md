# Project Management

Overview here...

## Standups

Standups are held daily to gain insight into what was accomplished and what is to be worked on that day.

This is an opportunity for the PM to gather project status and for developers to bring up issues that may be blocking 
progress.

These meetings should last no longer than 15 minutes as everyone on the team is there. If an issue needs to be discussed
in depth then another meeting should be scheduled with only the necessary individuals.
