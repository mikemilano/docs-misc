# Priority

## Blocker
Any task which need to be resolved prior to next release should have the priority of blocker. No releases, other than hotfixes, can be accomplished until this task is marked as "Complete". Note: this priority setting should be used for reopened tasks which leave the develop branch in an unstable state for deployment.

## Critical
Any task which causes severe site issues \(site down or 'red route' failures'\). These are typically also labeled with "hotfix" and processed via the Hotfix workflow.

## Major
Functionality failure or item which is impeding the primary goals of the site but does not meet "Critical" priority requirements and can be released on the next scheduled release.

## Minor
