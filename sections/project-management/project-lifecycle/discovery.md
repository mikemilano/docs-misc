# Discovery

The discovery phase consists of the following:

## Kickoff Meeting

Used to introduce members of the client and Thinkbean teams to one another as well as outline the process we will be following during the discovery phase and beyond.

## Stakeholder Interviews

All stakeholder groups should be interviewed. (Project stakeholders are individuals and organizations that are actively involved in the project, or whose interests may be affected as a result of project execution or project completion - including users. They may also exert influence over the project's objectives and outcomes.) 

Project Sponsors and Sponsor Designates should be documented during this phase. Project Sponsors are individuals who are ultimately responsible for the successful delivery of the project. Project Designates are individuals who will work with Thinkbean to ensure the project delivers the sponsors' vision.

## Problem Statement

The problem statement provides details for the following outline structure:
* The problem:
* Affects:
* The impact of which is:
* A successful solution would be:


## Vision Statement

This statement clearly and concisely communicates your business's overall goals, and can serve as a tool for strategic decision-making across the company. 
E.g. Boy Scouts of America: To prepare every eligible youth in America to become a responsible, participating citizen and leader who is guided by the Scout Oath and Law.

## Business Goals

Business goals are general statements of achievement. 
E.g. Increase transparency of data

## Metrics of Success

What are the objective and subjective means of determining if this is a successful project?
E.g. 10,000 unique visitors a month, increase of traffic from mini-sentinel site, increase of report views from the mini-sentinel site

## Risks

Risks are things which can happen and have an affect on the project. A risk assessment provides clarity of the following:
* Risk identification
* Potential impact
* Likelihood of occurance
* Mitigation strategy
* Response plan

## Project Balance

The project balance is a priority measure of five factors:
* Schedule
* Quality
* Cost
* Scope
* Agility

## User Goals

This starts out by documenting the different types of users, typically grouped by purpose (such as first time visitor, consultant, researcher, returning buyer, etc, etc...) but should also include at the broader grouping types of 'anonymous user', 'member', and 'site administrator'. 

User goals are written as user stories in the following format:
As a *user type*, I want to *do something*, so that I can *benefit*.

These goals are then prioritized using the MoSCoW method which helps to define the project scope. Each goal will have one of the following labels attached:
* **M**ust have (minimum requirement for version 1.0 release)
* **S**hould have (not critical for version 1.0 but high priority enhancements)
* **C**ould have (include if project budget and timeline allows)
* **W**on't have (at least for now, but can be added in the future)
