# Project Life Cycle

A project life cycle typically follows the following outline:

* Site audit
* Discovery
* Planning
* Agile development


## Site Audit

Any potential project which involves a current site requires a site audit. A site audit documents the current status of a project. See the [site audit section](site-audit.md) for details.

## Discovery

All projects need a discovery phase which documents the desired outcome of the project. See the [discovery section](discovery.md) for details.

## Planning

This phase documents how to take the project from its current state to the desired outcome. See the [planning section](planning.md) for more details.

## Agile Development

We use agile methodologies to evaluate, adjust, organize, and action the results of the planning stage. This is a circular problem solving approach based around sprints. See the [agile development section](agile-development.md) for more details.
